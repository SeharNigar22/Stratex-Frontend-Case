PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The challenge was to add functionality to an employee management software. Searching was not working. New user couldn’t be added and delete was also not working. Also the data showing in the tables was hard coded. The form for adding new user had no validations applied on it so I added following functionalities stated below
1.	Global Filter for all tables
2.	Add User
3.	Delete User
4.	Validation
5.	Retrieving Data from Json File 

Outcomes:
At the end user is able to perform all the required tasks. I had to think from user’s perspective. I tried to make it user responsive and added every bit for user convenience. I tried to show messages on add and delete users so that a user is informed every time he /she performs a task. 

How long did you spend on this assignment? What would you have done different if you had more time?
I spent 2.5 hours on this assignment. I tried to focus on the best approach possible. Had to be clear about what I was going to do so that I could code smoothly without any delay. Understood all the requirements first and then started coding. If I had more time 
1.	I would have saved data in json file so that all the data was saved there and data was not lost after the page reload. 
2.	I had spent more time on validations.
3.	I had show dialogue boxes for confirmations.
What are focus areas if your code would have to be part of an actual application? 
I would focus on:
1.	Coding pattern
2.	Naming Conventions
3.	Code Optimization
4.	Performance
